A privacy specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring that an organization's data handling practices comply with privacy laws and regulations. They are responsible for developing and implementing privacy policies, conducting privacy impact assessments, and providing guidance on privacy best practices. Privacy specialists also often serve as the point of contact for data subjects who have privacy-related concerns or requests. Their role is to ensure that the organization respects individuals' privacy rights and protects their personal data from unauthorized access or misuse. In contrast, privacy engineers are responsible for implementing technical measures to protect data privacy. They work on designing and developing systems and applications with privacy-enhancing features, such as data encryption, access controls, and anonymization techniques. Privacy engineers collaborate closely with software developers and IT teams to integrate privacy protections into the organization's technology infrastructure.

To put it simply, a privacy specialist is like a legal advisor for privacy matters within an organization. They ensure that the company's practices align with privacy laws and regulations, and they handle privacy-related inquiries from individuals. On the other hand, privacy engineers are like architects and builders who construct the technical safeguards to protect data privacy. They work on incorporating privacy features into the organization's systems and applications, similar to how a house builder installs security systems and locks to protect the residents' privacy and security. Both roles are essential for maintaining a strong privacy posture within an organization, with the specialist focusing on legal and policy aspects and the engineer focusing on technical implementation.
