Differential privacy in AI is a technique used to protect the privacy of individuals when analyzing sensitive data. It works by adding noise or randomization to the query results, ensuring that the output of the analysis does not reveal information about any specific individual in the dataset. This noise is carefully calibrated to balance the privacy of individuals with the accuracy of the analysis. By doing so, differential privacy allows organizations to derive valuable insights from sensitive data while preventing the disclosure of personal information. This is particularly important in AI, where large datasets are often used to train machine learning models and make predictions. Differential privacy helps to mitigate the risk of re-identification and unauthorized use of personal data, thereby enhancing the trust and ethical use of AI systems.

Imagine you have a jar of marbles, each representing a person's data. Differential privacy is like adding a little bit of glitter to each marble before taking a handful out to study. This glitter makes it impossible to know which specific marbles were selected, protecting the privacy of individuals. Even though the glitter adds some randomness, it still allows you to understand general trends and patterns within the jar without compromising the privacy of any individual marble. In this way, differential privacy ensures that valuable insights can be gained from the data while safeguarding the personal information of the individuals it represents.
