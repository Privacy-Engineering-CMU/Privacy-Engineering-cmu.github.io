AR/VR applications that handle biometric data must prioritize privacy and security to ensure the sensitive information is protected. Biometric data, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scans, is highly personal and requires special care in storage and processing. To safeguard this data, AR/VR applications typically employ encryption techniques to secure the biometric information both during storage and transmission. Additionally, access controls and authentication measures are implemented to restrict unauthorized access to the biometric data. Furthermore, many AR/VR applications opt for on-device processing of biometric data, minimizing the need to transmit this sensitive information over networks, thereby reducing the risk of interception or unauthorized access.

An analogy to understand this is to think of biometric data as a valuable item stored in a safe. AR/VR applications act as the custodians of this safe, ensuring that it is securely locked with advanced encryption and access controls. By keeping the safe within the user's premises (on-device processing), the risk of someone breaking into the safe during transportation (transmission over networks) is significantly reduced. This approach prioritizes the protection of the valuable contents (biometric data) and minimizes the chances of unauthorized access or misuse.
