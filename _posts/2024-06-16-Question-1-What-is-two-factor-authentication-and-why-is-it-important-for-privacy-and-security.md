Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. These factors typically include something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a smartphone or a security token), or something the user is (like a fingerprint or facial recognition). By requiring two different factors, 2FA adds an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access accounts or sensitive information. This is important for privacy and security because it significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, identity theft, and data breaches. Even if a hacker manages to obtain a user's password, they would still need the second factor to gain access, making it much harder for them to compromise the account.

To put it simply, two-factor authentication is like using two keys to unlock a safe. When you only have one key (like a password), it's easier for someone else to make a copy and access your belongings. But with two keys (like a password and a code sent to your phone), even if someone manages to steal one key, they still can't open the safe without the other key. This extra layer of protection makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to access your personal information, keeping it safe and secure.
