The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law that was implemented in the European Union (EU) in 2018. It aims to give individuals more control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. The GDPR introduces several key principles that organizations must adhere to when processing personal data, including the requirement for explicit consent from individuals for data processing, the right to access and rectify personal data, the right to erasure (or "right to be forgotten"), and the obligation to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data. Additionally, the GDPR imposes strict requirements on organizations to report data breaches and can levy significant fines for non-compliance.

In simple terms, the GDPR is like a set of rules that companies and organizations in the EU have to follow to protect people's personal information. It gives individuals more say in what happens to their data and makes sure that companies handle this information carefully and securely. For example, it's like having a lock on a diary where only the owner has the key, and if someone tries to break the lock or read the diary without permission, there are consequences. The GDPR is designed to make sure that people's personal information is respected and kept safe by the companies that collect it.
