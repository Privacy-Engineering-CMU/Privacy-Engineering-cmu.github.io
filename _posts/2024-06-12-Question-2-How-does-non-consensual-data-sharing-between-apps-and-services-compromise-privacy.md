Non-consensual data sharing between apps and services compromises privacy by violating the fundamental principle of user consent and control over personal information. When apps and services share data without the user's explicit permission, it can lead to the unauthorized collection, storage, and utilization of sensitive personal information. This can result in a range of privacy risks, including identity theft, financial fraud, and exposure of private communications. Furthermore, non-consensual data sharing can lead to the creation of comprehensive user profiles, which can be exploited for targeted advertising, manipulation, and discrimination. It also undermines the user's trust in the digital ecosystem, as they may feel betrayed and vulnerable due to the unauthorized dissemination of their personal data.

To illustrate, imagine your home as your personal data, and different apps and services as various visitors. Non-consensual data sharing is like a visitor entering your home without your permission and rummaging through your belongings, taking photos, and sharing them with others without your knowledge. This invasion not only violates your sense of security and control over your personal space but also exposes you to potential risks and exploitation. Just as you expect visitors to respect your privacy and seek permission before accessing your home, apps and services should uphold the same principles when it comes to handling your personal data.
