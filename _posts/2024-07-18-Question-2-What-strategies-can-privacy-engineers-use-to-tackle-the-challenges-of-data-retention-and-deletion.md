Privacy engineers can employ several strategies to address the challenges of data retention and deletion. Firstly, they can implement data minimization techniques, ensuring that only the necessary data is collected and retained. This involves regularly reviewing the data being collected and stored, and deleting any information that is no longer needed for its original purpose. Additionally, privacy engineers can utilize encryption and pseudonymization to protect retained data, making it more difficult to attribute information to specific individuals. Another important strategy is the implementation of automated data deletion processes, such as setting up regular schedules to delete data that has exceeded its retention period. This can be complemented with robust access controls and audit trails to ensure that data is only accessed and deleted by authorized personnel. Furthermore, privacy engineers can leverage technologies like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation to analyze and derive insights from data without retaining personally identifiable information, thus reducing the need for long-term data retention.

To illustrate, imagine a library that only keeps books that are actively being borrowed or are essential for reference. The librarian regularly reviews the collection, returning or removing books that are no longer relevant. Additionally, the books are stored in a secure, locked cabinet, and any personal notes or markings in the books are encrypted to protect readers' privacy. The library also has a system in place to automatically discard outdated newspapers and magazines, and only authorized staff members are able to access and manage the collection. By employing these strategies, the library ensures that only necessary materials are retained, and that patrons' privacy is respected and protected.
