Privacy in an interconnected society refers to the ability of individuals to control the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information in a world where technology and communication networks are increasingly interconnected. It encompasses the right to keep certain aspects of one's life and identity private, as well as the right to make informed choices about how personal data is utilized by various entities. In this context, privacy is about maintaining autonomy and individual agency in a digital environment where data is constantly being generated, collected, and analyzed. It involves safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring transparency and accountability in data practices, and empowering individuals to manage their digital footprint.

To illustrate, imagine privacy in an interconnected society as having curtains in your home. Just as curtains provide a level of control over who can see into your living space, privacy in an interconnected society involves having control over who can access your personal information in the digital realm. It's about being able to decide when to open the curtains and share certain aspects of your life, while also having the ability to close them to protect your privacy. Just as you wouldn't want strangers peering into your home without permission, privacy in an interconnected society involves setting boundaries and having the tools to enforce them in the digital world.
