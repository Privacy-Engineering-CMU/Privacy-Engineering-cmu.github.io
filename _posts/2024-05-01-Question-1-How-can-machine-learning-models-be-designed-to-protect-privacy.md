Machine learning models can be designed to protect privacy through various techniques such as differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption. Differential privacy involves adding noise to the input data to prevent individual data points from being identifiable, while still allowing the model to make accurate predictions. Federated learning allows the model to be trained across multiple decentralized devices, ensuring that the raw data never leaves the user's device, thus reducing the risk of privacy breaches. Homomorphic encryption enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, thereby protecting sensitive information during the model training process. Additionally, techniques like model distillation and adversarial training can be employed to enhance the privacy of machine learning models by making them more robust against privacy attacks.

To illustrate, imagine a group of chefs working together to create a new recipe without sharing their secret ingredients. Each chef adds a small amount of a random ingredient to their dish, ensuring that no one can identify the individual components. Then, they taste and combine their dishes to create the final recipe without ever revealing their original ingredients. This collaborative approach allows them to protect their unique recipes while still achieving a delicious result, much like how machine learning models can protect privacy through techniques like differential privacy and federated learning, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure while still producing accurate predictions.
