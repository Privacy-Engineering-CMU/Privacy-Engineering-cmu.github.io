The leakage of educational records can have a significant impact on students and their futures. Educational records often contain sensitive information such as academic performance, disciplinary actions, and personal details. If these records are leaked, students may experience a breach of privacy, leading to potential identity theft, cyberbullying, or discrimination. For example, leaked disciplinary records could unfairly tarnish a student's reputation, affecting their chances of admission to higher education institutions or employment opportunities. Moreover, leaked academic records could lead to unfair judgment or comparison with peers, causing undue stress and anxiety for students. Additionally, the exposure of personal information can make students vulnerable to targeted advertising, phishing attempts, and other online threats, compromising their digital safety and well-being.

To put it simply, imagine educational records as a personal diary that contains all your achievements, struggles, and secrets. If someone were to sneak a peek at your diary and share its contents with others, it could lead to embarrassment, misunderstandings, and even harm your reputation. Similarly, when educational records are leaked, students may face privacy violations, unfair treatment, and potential risks to their safety. Just like how you wouldn't want your private diary to be shared without your consent, students deserve to have their educational records protected to ensure a fair and secure future.
