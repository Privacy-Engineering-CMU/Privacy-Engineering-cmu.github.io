Privacy by design in privacy engineering is based on several core principles that aim to embed privacy into the design and operation of systems, products, and services. The first principle is proactive not reactive; this means that privacy should be considered from the outset of any project or system, rather than being an afterthought. The second principle is privacy as the default setting, which requires that the highest privacy settings are the default settings, ensuring that users do not have to take additional steps to protect their privacy. The third principle is embedded into design, which involves integrating privacy into the design and architecture of systems and processes. The fourth principle is full functionality, ensuring that privacy is not achieved at the expense of functionality, and the fifth principle is end-to-end security, which involves ensuring that privacy is maintained throughout the entire data lifecycle.

To explain this in simpler terms, imagine building a house. Privacy by design is like planning the layout of the house with privacy in mind from the beginning. It means making sure that the doors and windows have locks by default, rather than having to add them later. It's also about making sure that the design of the house itself ensures privacy, such as having a fence around the property. Just like how a well-designed house prioritizes security and privacy, privacy by design in engineering prioritizes building systems and products with privacy as a fundamental consideration from the start.
