When personal data is permanently stored on blockchain technologies without the possibility of deletion, it raises significant privacy concerns. Blockchain is designed to be immutable, meaning that once data is added to a blockchain, it cannot be altered or removed. This feature, while beneficial for ensuring data integrity and security, becomes problematic when it comes to personal data. Since personal data is typically subject to privacy regulations such as the GDPR, the inability to delete or modify this data on a blockchain can lead to non-compliance with these regulations. Additionally, the transparent nature of blockchain means that personal data stored on it is visible to all participants in the network, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties. As a result, the permanent storage of personal data on blockchain technologies without the possibility of deletion can pose serious privacy risks and legal implications.

Imagine a public library where once a book is placed on a shelf, it cannot be taken off or modified in any way. Now, imagine that instead of books, personal information such as names, addresses, and financial details are stored on these unchangeable shelves. Anyone who visits the library can see this information, and there's no way to remove or update it. This lack of control over the stored information can lead to privacy violations and legal non-compliance, highlighting the potential risks of permanently storing personal data on blockchain technologies.
