Surveillance technologies challenge traditional notions of privacy by blurring the boundaries between public and private spaces. With the advancement of surveillance cameras, facial recognition systems, and data analytics, individuals are constantly being monitored and tracked in both physical and digital environments. This pervasive surveillance erodes the expectation of privacy in public spaces, as well as in online activities. Furthermore, the collection and analysis of personal data through surveillance technologies raise concerns about the potential for abuse, discrimination, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. As a result, individuals may feel a sense of vulnerability and loss of control over their personal information and activities, impacting their ability to freely express themselves and engage in private interactions without fear of being monitored or judged.

To illustrate, imagine you are walking through a busy city street, but everywhere you go, there are invisible eyes watching your every move. These eyes not only see you, but they also analyze your behavior, track your movements, and store this information for future use. This constant surveillance makes you feel like you have nowhere to escape and be truly alone. It's like living in a glass house where anyone can peek in at any time, leaving you feeling exposed and unable to fully relax or be yourself. This intrusion into your personal space challenges the traditional idea of privacy, where you should have the freedom to move and act without constant scrutiny.
