Using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions poses several privacy risks. These networks are often unsecured, making it easier for hackers to intercept data transmitted between the user and the network. This means that sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data can be vulnerable to unauthorized access. Additionally, cybercriminals can set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots with names similar to legitimate ones, tricking users into connecting to these malicious networks. Once connected, these hackers can monitor and capture all data transmitted over the network, putting users at risk of identity theft and financial fraud. Furthermore, public Wi-Fi networks are often used by a large number of people, increasing the likelihood of potential threats and unauthorized access to personal information.

To put it simply, using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions is like sending a postcard through the mail instead of using a sealed envelope. When you send sensitive information over a public Wi-Fi network, it's like writing your personal details on a postcard for everyone to see. Just as anyone can read a postcard as it travels through the postal system, hackers can intercept and view your data as it travels through an unsecured Wi-Fi network. It's important to treat sensitive transactions like valuable items that need to be securely packaged and delivered, which means using a secure and private network to protect your personal information.
